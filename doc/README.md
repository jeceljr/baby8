# Baby 8 documentation

The **.pdf** files here are generated, with the sources
having been created with LibreOffice.

The slides in **baby8.odp** are a reasonably detailed presentation
about the processor's instruction set, assembler and implementation.

The **control_fsm.ods** spreadsheet is just a "thinking on a white board"
mess to help design the control unit for the processor. As such it doesn't
use a very consistent notation.
